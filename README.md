- Some products may not have prices displayed, which can cause errors
- The scraper includes basic error handling but may need improvements
- Network issues or slow connections may affect results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ChromeDriver version mismatch:**
   - Ensure ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version
   - Download the correct version from the ChromeDriver website

2. **Element not found errors:**
   - Amazon's HTML structure may have changed
   - Check and update CSS selectors in the code

3. **Bot detection:**
   - Amazon may block automated requests
   - The stealth mode helps but is not foolproof
   - Consider adding random delays between requests

4. **No data available:**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the product search term is valid
   - Amazon may be blocking your IP temporarily
